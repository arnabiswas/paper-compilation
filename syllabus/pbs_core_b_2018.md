##Intro  to  Concepts

Halberda,  J.  (in  progress).(Informal  piece) A  ‘chapter’that  Justin  iswriting  on  categories,  psychological  dimensions,  concepts.

Fodor,  J.A.  (1981). Representations. A section  from  a  Fodor  chapter  (1981)  about  Nativism  and  Empiricism  of  concepts.
- Start  reading  at  “Where  do  concepts  come  from”  pg.  260  and  end  at  “one  ought  to  succumb”  pg.  269). Read it  carefully.

Barsalou et  al  (2003).  Grounding  conceptual  knowledge  in  modality-specific  systems. Trends  in  Cognitive  Science,7(2),  84-91.
- A  piece about  the  possibility  that  all  concepts  are  simply  the  collection  of  perceptual  experiences  we  have  with  those  categories. This  view  has  ties  to  current  hot  topics  in  many  areas  of  our  science  (e.g.,  Embodied  Cognition,  VWM  reuses  early  visual  areas  for  remembering,  the  imagery  debate. Barsalou  et  al. is  a  TiCS  overview  in  support  of  perceptual  reuse.

Dove,  G.  (2009).  Beyond  perceptual  symbols:  A  call  for  representational  pluralism. Cognition,  110(3),  412-431.
- Dove  is  a  pretty  long  paper  pointing  out  some  problems  with  the  whole  idea  of  perceptual  reuse. We suggest  skimming  throughout  to  get  a  sense  of  some  of  the  problems  he  raises,  and  using  this  to  think  of  your  own  problems  with  it,  or  solutions  that  can  be proposed.


## Theorizing  about  Prototypes,  Exemplars,  Grandmother  Cells,  Classical  Theories  of  Concepts  in  Cognitive  Neuroscience  and  Neuroscience

Freedman,  D.J.,  Risenhuber,  M.,  Poggio,  T.,  &  Miller,  E.K.  (2003). A  comparison  of  primate  prefrontal  and  inferior  temporal  cortices  during  visual  categorization.  The  Journal  of  Neuroscience,  23(12),  5235-5245.
- Freedman  is  an  example  of  Prototypes and  Categorical  Perception  from  category  learning  in  monkey  cortex.  Understand  the  set  up. Understand  how  the  stimuli  are  organized,  then  understand the  task  &  result. Don’t  stress  to  know  every  detail.

Quiroga,  R.Q.,  Reddy,  L.,  Kreiman,  G.,  Koch  &  Fried  (2005).Invariant  visual  representation  by  single  neurons  in  the  human  brain.  Nature,435.
- Grandmother  Cells  in  Neuroscience: Quiroga is  an  early  demonstration  that  a  single  cell  (in  ITC  in  this  case)  can  be  triggered  by  a  high-level  category  (in  this  case  the  face  of  a  famous  person). Do  not  read  the  entire  thing  in  detail. Scan  and  get  the  main  idea  and  just  a  bit  of  the  results.

Huth,  A.G.,  Nishimoto,  S.,  Vu, A.T.,  &Gallant,  J.L.(2012).  A  Continuous  Semantic  Space  Describes  the  Representation  of  Thousands  of  Object  and  Action  Categories  across  the  Human  Brain. Neuron,  76(6),  1210-1224.
- Exemplar  Approach  in Cognitive  Neuroscience:  Huth  et  al.is  a  current  piece  touching  on  the  possibility  of  a  continuous  semantic  representational  space  and  relations  across  concepts.  Get  the  idea,  watch  online  videos  about  the  method  if  you  like,  but  don’t  need  to  read  the  whole  thing  in  detail.

Fodor,  J.A.  (1981).  Representations.(283-286) (Problems  with  definitions: Almost no  concept  has  one.  Fodor  Precis  on  the  example  “to  paint”.
- Read  “State  of  the  evidence”  pg.  283  until  the  words  “almost  always  don’t  work”  pg.  288)

Armstrong,  S.L.,  Gleitman,  L.R.  &  Gleitman,  H.  (1983).  What  some  concepts  might  not  be.  Cognition,  13,  263-308. (Problems  with  prototypes,  everybody  has  got  one.
- Scan  through  this  reading,  the  important  thing  to  know  is  the  result  with  odd  numbers))

## Sensation  &  Perception,  Early  Computation  and Concepts

Marr,  D.  (1982). Vision  :  a  computational  investigation  into  the  human  representation  and  processing  of  visual  information.San  Francisco:  W.H.  Freeman.

Zabala,  F.,  Polidoro,  P.,  Robie,  A.,  Branson,  K.,  Perona,  P.,  &Dickinson,  M.H.(2012).  A  Simple  Strategy  for  Detecting  Moving  Objects  during  Locomotion  Revealed  by  Animal-Robot  Interactions. Current  Biology,  22(14),  1344-1350.
- Zabalaet  al  is  a  cool  use  of  robot  flies  to  test  basic  psychophysics  in  a  freely  behaving  fly. It  is  a  little  long.    I  suggest  that  you  do  not  get  too  lost  in  the  details,  focus  on  understanding  the  task,  and  the  behavior,  and  why  this  behavior  naturally  emerges  from  the  animal-animal-environment  interaction

Gallistel,  C.  R.  (1989).  Animal  cognition:  The  representation  of  space,  time,  and  number.  Annual Review  of  Psychology,  40,  155-189.  
- Psychological  dimensions:  Read  Gallistel  to  get  a  sense  of  algorithms  and  dimensions  represented  by  various  animals.    Be  amazed  by  the  animals.    This  chapter  is  a  little  long  but  it  rewards  time  spent  relaxing  with  it.

Bueti,  D.&  Walsh,  V.(2009). The  parietal  cortex  and  the  representation  of  time,  space,  number  and  other  magnitudes.  Phil.  Trans.  R.  Soc.  B  364,  1831-1840.
- Read  Beuti  &  Walsh  for  the  discussion  that  TIME,  SPACE,  and  NUMBER  might  be  represented  by  a  single  domain-general  magnitude  system.    This  is  a  view  that  continues  to  be  discussed.

# Strings,  Rules,  and  Combination  of  Concepts

Fodor,  J.  A.,  &  Pylyshyn,  Z.  W.  (1988).  Connectionism  and  cognitive  architecture:  A  critical  analysis. Cognition,28(1-2),  3-71.
- Read  in  full  Fodor  and  Pylyshyn. Think  of  their  attack  on  Connectionism  as  also  applying  to  any  proposal  for  concepts  where  the  proposed  units  will  fail  to  compose. A  discussion  question  for  this  topic  might  be:  “consider  the  following,  I  suggest  to  you  that  grandmother  cells  will  not  compose  (i.e.,  a  combination  of  two  grandmother  cells  will  not  result  in  a  complex  representation  whose  meaning  is  a  syntactic  combination  of  the  subunits  that  make  it  up  (e.g.,  PET-FISH));  nor  will  Bayesian  models;  nor  will  brain  states  (as  currently  discussed  in  neuroscience);  nor  will  distributed  representations;  nor  will  embodied  representations;  nor  will  prototypes;  nor  will  exemplars;  nor  will  reactivation  patterns  of  earlier  sensory  activity,  and  so  on  and  so  on.    And  so,  based  on  Fodor  and  Pylyshyn’s  argument,  all  of  these  ideas  might  be  non-starters,  in  so  far  as  they  will  fail  to  capture  the  demonstrable  productivity  of  the  mind.    And,  for  your  own  work,  if  you  cannot  show  that  Fodor  and  Pylyshyn  are  wrong,  and  if  you  cannot  show  that  your  way  of understanding  the  mind  captures  the  productivity  of  the  mind,  then  you  must  be  very  humble  about  the  utility  of  your own  work.    You  must  admit  that  your  current  model  for  the  mind/brain  will  eventually  need  to  change.

- Read  Science  paper  from  Marcus  et  al. It  shows  that  infants  can  learn  a  rule  structure  in  a  sequence  of  sounds. Think  of  this  as  a  first  (developmentally)  demonstration  of  syntactic  relations  across  units.

- Then  read  Kemp  &  Tenenbaumto  see  a  Bayesian  approach  to  finding  such  syntactic  (or  higher  order)  structure.

- We suggest  that  you  just  skim  Buschman  et  al. Get  the  main  idea  that  that  Rules  may  be  maintained  and  bound  to  target  representations  via  neuronal  synchrony. Read  details  only  if  you  want  to  know  more. Supporting  material on  neuronal  synchrony
